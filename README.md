# nodeAnglarjs

## Experience 
- in Node Js: beginner and in jquery im intermediate I have also used slick
- for testing I used chai and mocha


## why I chose this language?
- node is fast and it has a lot of helper middlewares 
- non-blocking calls
- npm is huge and resourceful 


## what I have accomplished?
- I have retrieved data from Expedia's API using "request promise" and node
- I am sending a GET request from front end using jquery ajax request 
- the data in front end is looped over and html tags are created using jquery methods and appended to the DOM
- also I have added a responsive carousel using slick to make it appealing to the user
- I have deployed the app to Heroku and here is a link: https://stormy-citadel-53463.herokuapp.com
- Also the app now builds and tests on Travis-CI I added a .travis.yml file that tests if the app runs on node 8 and checkes the tests that I have written
- I have written 4 tests to check if: server responds with status 200
