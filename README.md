# nodeAnglarjs

# Experience 
- in Node Js: beginner and in jquery im intermediate i have also used slick
- angular js in the title is a mistake, sorry!


# why I chose this language?
- node is fast and it has a lot of helper middlewares 
- non-blocking calls
- npm is huge and resourceful 


# what i have accomplished?
- I have retrieved the data from the API using request promise and node
- I am sending a GET request from the front end using jquery ajax request 
- the data in front end is looped over where html tags are created using jquery methods 
- to create divs and append them to the dom 
- also i have added style to make it appealing to the user
